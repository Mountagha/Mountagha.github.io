* I recently learned Rust and wanted to used it in a real life project for more understanding.
* Unlike [link](COOL) which is developped in a monolithic way, KECC adopts the very recents compiler development technics which made it very modular and closed to what is used in real compilers structures like [link] LLVM... [read more](./kecc-compiler.md)
