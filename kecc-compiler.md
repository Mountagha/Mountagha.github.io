## The Kecc compiler.
This is my second post on compilers. 
KECC is C compiler developped at [link](KAIST) lab using the Rust programming language. There are few reasons that made me got into another compiler project 
* I recently learned Rust and wanted to used it in a real life project for more understanding.
* Unlike [link](COOL) which is developped in a monolithic way, KECC adopts the very recents compiler development technics which made it very modular and closed to what is used in real compilers structures like [link] LLVM.
* This is my occasion to implement real life optimizations used in real life compilers
