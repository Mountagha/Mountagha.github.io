**Hi, I’m Mamadou Mountagha BAH, a passionate software engineer.**

I hold an MSc in Computer Science from Sherbrooke University, a charming city nestled in southern Quebec. Prior to that, I earned my degree in Computer Engineering at the National Applied School of Science in Kenitra, Morocco. My love for programming runs deep—especially when it’s close to the bare metal—but my true passion lies in the fascinating intersection of **machine learning** and **compiler technology**.

Lately, I’ve been diving into these areas with an eagerness to contribute to groundbreaking projects like PyTorch, TVM, Paddle, and LLVM/MLIR. These fields inspire me to push boundaries and explore the future of computing.

When I’m not in front of a keyboard, I stay active through weightlifting, training five days a week. I’ve recently taken up running, completing my first half-marathon a few months ago, and now I aim to log 20 to 25 km of slow running each week. Oh, and I love driving! I prefer manual cars (yes, even though they’re becoming rare), and I’m working toward earning my commercial driver’s license (CDL), motorbike license, and eventually, an amateur pilot’s license.

Feel free to check out my recent projects on GitHub and get in touch with me via email or on Twitter. I’m always happy to connect!
